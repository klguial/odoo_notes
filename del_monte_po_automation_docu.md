### PO Automation Notes
- Allocation -> allocated products to distributor on a monthly basis (date start, date end). details include product name, product source (plant), number of products allocated (allocation), cases

- ODOO STATUS
	- draft
	- submitted
	- for_dr_conf_sending
	- for_dr_conf
	- confirmed_dr
	- for_delivery_conf
	- confirmed_del
	- enroute
	- received
	- done
	- cancelled
	
- CRON functions
	- cron_send_files
	- cron_execute_queue
	- cron_create_files
	- cron_read_files
	- cron_get_remote_files
	- cron_send_received (removed)

- **Draft** Status
	- (NOTHING: for PO Drafts not submitted within RDD month, must not be proceeded)
	- PO object is `dmpi.po.sale` with inherited properties from `mail.thread` and 'ir.needaction_mixin'
	- Upon creation, ODOO PO number is created.
		- Check function `create()` under `dmpi.po.sale` model
	- On creating Purchase order, required fields must first be set before being able to choose the allocated products.
		- Required Fields: Dsitributor, Ship To, Plant, Source, Distributor Channel, Reference No
		- `line_ids`: related to `dmpi.po.sale.line` object. Has the specifications on product qty, allocation price etc. 
	- Load configuration: CV (container van) or 10 Wheeler. Also depends on source location. 
		- CV for offshore
		- 10Wheel for inland
		- Check function `on_change_deliver_source()`
	- Cannot submit PO unless load requirements are met
	- Truck Load and Truck Load Weight
		- `max_truck_load_wieght_kg = 15000`. set at `dmpi.po.config`
		- `max_van_load_wieght_kg = 18000` (container van). set at `dmpi.po.config`
		- `load_configuration`: either CV or 10W
		- max and min `truck_load` (%) and max and min `truck_load_weight` are the constraints
		- Truck Load (%) refers to the space occupied by the products (simply called load)
		- Truck Load Weight (%) refers to the weight of the products (simply called weight)
		- Allocation is per integers of pallet. Each product has a given number of cases per pallet.
		- `weight = 100 * product_weight * qty_ordered / max_truck_weight`
		- `load = 100 * qty / allowed_cases`
		- **Check function `_get_truck_load()`**
	- Upon submission of PO, PO Dates adjust based on Source type (inland = 5 days or offshore = 15 days). 
		- **Check function `submit_po()`**
		- **Status to `submitted`**
	
- **Submitted** Status
	-  Po is submitted to SAP
	- P000003515 (sample po)
	- action `so_create`
	- check purchase orders with `status = 'submitted'` and `sent_to_sap_so = False`
	- ODOO will create SO (Sap Order?) for inbound to SAP.
	- see function `so_create()` in `sap.py`
	- ODOO cretes writes product line records into csv file with filename as shown below. Data includes PO No. etc.  `so_create_P000002084_20171130.csv` (odoo PO no. and po date submtted)
	- set `sent_to_sap_no = True`{:.language-python} and record `sent_to_sap_so_date`
 	- action `read_dr`
	- SAP will then read the file in return would send back a DR (delivery receipt) together with its details such as:
		- sap_so_no
		- dr_no
		- dr_date
		- dr_lines (sap_line_no, odoo_line_no, product, dr_qty)

	- status to `for_dr_conf_sending`
	
- **For DR Sending** Status

	- `sent_to_dist_po_conf: True` (PO Conf to Dist), and date record date `sent_to_dist_po_conf_date`
	- status to `for_dr_conf`
