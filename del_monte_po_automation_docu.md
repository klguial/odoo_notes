	- cron_send_received (removed)

- **Draft** Status
	- (NOTHING: for PO Drafts not submitted within RDD month, must not be proceeded)
	- PO object is `dmpi.po.sale` with inherited properties from `mail.thread` and `ir.needaction_mixin`
	- Upon creation, ODOO PO number is created.
		- Check function *create()* under dmpi.po.sale model
	- On creating Purchase order, required fields must first be set before being able to choose the allocated products.
		- Required Fields: Dsitributor, Ship To, Plant, Source, Distributor Channel, Reference No
		- line_ids: related to dmpi.po.sale.line object. Has the specifications on product qty, allocation price etc. 
	- Load configuration: CV (container van) or 10 Wheeler. Also depends on source location. 
		- CV for offshore
		- 10Wheel for inland
		- Check function *on_change_deliver_source()*
	- Cannot submit PO unless load requirements are met
	- Truck Load and Truck Load Weight
		- max_truck_load_wieght_kg = 15000. set at dmpi.po.config
		- max_van_load_wieght_kg = 18000 (container van). set at dmpi.po.config
		- load_configuration: either CV or 10W
		- max and min truck_load (%) and max and min truck_load_weight are the constraints
		- Truck Load (%) refers to the space occupied by the products (simply called load)
		- Truck Load Weight (%) refers to the weight of the products (simply called weight)
		- Allocation is per integers of pallet. Each product has a given number of cases per pallet.
		- weight = 100 * product_weight * qty_ordered / max_truck_weight
		- load = 100 * qty / allowed_cases
		- Check function *_get_truck_load()*
	- Upon submission of PO, PO Dates adjust based on Source type (inland = 5 days or offshore = 15 days). 
		- Check function *submit_po()*
		- Status &rightarrow; **submitted**
